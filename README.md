# BMID

  Some background first, this project started as a simple Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic Drive, I spent an entire summer(from Sophomore to Junior year) to research, study, and figure out the physics of these fascinating devices. The only issue was building it, and I only dreamed bigger. When I saw an in-air ionic propulsion video by "Plasma Channel" on Youtube, I decided to build an entire drone that can switch between in-air travel and in-water travel using only ionic propulsion. This is the BMID, the Bi-capable, Modular, Ionic Drone.
