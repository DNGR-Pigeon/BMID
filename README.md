# BMID

  The BMID is a personal research project, this project had no funding other than that provided by gracious donors such as Jim Burnham, also known as The Steam Clown. Additionally, the BMID had no intention to be efficient, but simply to work. 

Hi, My name is Joshua Ulloa, this project, currently in progress, is the result of a dream to take up a complex project far above my capabilities and then use the experience to learn and develop my abilities as an engineer. As I update, develop, and experiment with this project, feel free to chip in, or take it up yourself and learn as I am. With that said, Here begins the project!



# Background

    This device, the Bi-capable, Modular, Ionic Drone(BMID) utilizes solely ionic propulsion as a driving force, as such, this is an extraordinarily complicated project, I would only recomend taking this up if you have a LOT of time on your hands.
